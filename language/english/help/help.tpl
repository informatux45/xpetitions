    <h4 class="odd">Description</h4><br>

    Petitions module on line multilangues developped for XOOPS.<br>
    The forms can be accompanied by an CAPTCHA to avoid the spams (choices of 3 captchas).<br><br>
    You can create petitions as many as wish it to you.<br><br>
    Each petition can have 3 statutes:<br>
    * Active (the petition can be signed if the date of starting is not higher than the current date)<br>
    * Offline (the petition is not visible and cannot be signed)<br>
    * Archived (the petition is visible and consultable but cannot be signed)<br><br>
    A help is present on each page of the admin to help you with the various possible options.<br><br>
    The module has a style sheet which you can modify according to your graphic charters.<br><br>
